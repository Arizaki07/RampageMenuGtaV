>--- Overview ----<
Rampage is a Trainer / Modification for Grand Theft Auto V Story Mode

>--- How to Install ---<
Extract the .zip file and put the Rampage.asi and RampageFiles into your GTA V Directory.
Make sure you have the latest version of Alexander Blades ScriptHookV plugin (ScriptHookV.dll & dinput8.dll)

If GTA5 is installed on your main drive (C:) or you get any issues regarding not being able to save file make sure that your user account and the user group have the correct permissions for the game folder.

>--- Troubleshooting ---<
If you encounter any issues while loading such as "Settings.json missing" or "Hotkey.json missing", issues with loading of textures
or any other crashes on startup, try to delete the RampageFiles folder, dowload the latest version and restart GTA5.

--- Important Things ---
If you want to change a specific hotkey in the trainer you can change it in the Hotkey Manager under settings,
just click on the option and enter your new hotkey inside the window.

If you want to load your own custom header:
Download OpenIV (if you don`t already have it) navigate to RampageFiles/Textures and open Textures.ytd.
Now you can replace the texture "header_custom" with your own (512x128) also don`t change the name.

Log files are stored in RampageFiles/Logs if you have any issues you may want to look into these files.
